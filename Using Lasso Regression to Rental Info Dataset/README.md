# NYC-Public-School-SAT-Performance-Analysis-using-Pandas

## Overview
This project analyzes SAT performance data across New York City public schools to answer key questions about academic achievement. The SAT, a standardized test critical for college admissions, consists of three sections (math, reading, writing), each scored up to 800 points. This analysis helps stakeholders—such as policymakers, educators, and parents—understand school performance trends.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. **Top Math Schools**: Which schools have the highest average math scores (≥80% of the maximum score)?
2. **Top Performing Schools**: Which 10 schools have the highest combined SAT scores?
3. **Borough Variability**: Which NYC borough exhibits the most variability in total SAT scores?

## Dataset Overview
The dataset `schools.csv` contains:
- School names and borough locations
- Average scores for math, reading, and writing
- Percentage of students tested
